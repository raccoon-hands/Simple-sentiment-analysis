# Simple-sentiment-analysis
A university assignment exploring sentiment analysis using logisting regression and a neural network. 
This assignment starts by exploring practical implementations of NER and POS on a sentiment analysis dataset. Then two sentiment analysis tasks are carried out on different datasets: Logistic Regression is used for the Amazon reviews dataset, and a bi-directional RNN with LSTM is used for the Movie reviews dataset.
